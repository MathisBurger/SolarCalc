# Project information

I have built this app to make it easier for myself to check different solar offer from my mobile phone. Furthermore, it is just another project I wanted to build with swift and swiftUI. It provides the functionality to insert the data of your house and it will provide you with general information like autarky and co2 savings as well as different offers from different companies. It uses an external API to fetch these information. 

# Updates

This project is done for now. There will not be any further updates except from compatibility updates.
